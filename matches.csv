Matterport: https://my.matterport.com/show/?m=iWVPCi5bGu2.  Seeking 12-36 month term with demo clause, so is likely amenable to short term lease. 

JW - I think this site works good for repair work, however, I don't think there's spot for a break space or much parking. Would recommend pairing this spot with a coworking space if none will allow R&M as location is optimal in ODD.

Need to ensure we are comfortable with zoning given quasi retail.
